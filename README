Code to run the Archon controller for the LS4 camera
D. Rabinowitz 2024 Jul 8 

Implementation:
  This code was built on top of the SDSS Python code written to 
  control their Archon controllers (see doc/controller.pdf).
  
  The code was augmented to allow synchronized I/O to/from
  multiple controllers using the synchronization mechanism
  built into the controllers (see doc/Archon.pdf)

  The "actor" object for which the original SDSS code was
  designed is not used in this implementation. Instead,
  a basic command server and coordination program (ls4_ccp.py) was
  written specifically to interface with the control and
  scheduling system used by the La Silla - Quest survey at the
  ESO Schmidt.

Status:
  The code has been extensively test in a laboratory setting at
Yale Wright Lab. The interface with the scheduling software has
not been tested. The test script included here allows basic
functions expected by the scheduling software to be tested.

TBD: The scheduler code (written in C/C++) was written to
control a different camera (LS4 QUEST camera). This code (see
python/scheduler_camera.c) must be modified to work with
ls4_ccp.py

requirements:
  Python environment with required modules (ls4_venv)
  bash shell

Installation:
  python3 -m venv  ~/ls4_venv
  source scripts/setup.bash
  pip install wheel
  pip install -r ls4_requirements.txt
  cd archon-main
  pip install .

Configuration:
  see scripts/test.bash

Usage:
  bash
  cd source directory for this package
  source scripts/setup.bash
  scripts/test.bash

output:
  diagnostic messages are written to stdout and stderr
  FITs files are written to the configured data path
